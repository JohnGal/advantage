In the LargestCombinedNumber class there is a single static method: 
largestCombinedNumber(List<Integer> l). This method accepts a list of non negative integers
as argument (there is no error handling, using any other input can result in unexpected results) 
and returns their largest possible combined number as a string.

In argestCombinedNumberTest class there is a test method that tests the above class for the following cases:
given [50,2,1,9] it returns "95021"
given [5,50,56] it returns "56550"
given [420,42,423] it returns "42423420"
given [56,6,6,50] it returns "665650"
